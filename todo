A Ton of shit is still needed for dank-paste

* curl instructions, pastebin and url shortener both work with curl
* static/dank.js is a mess, needs cleaned up and commented
* almost none of the source is commented, it is simple enough to follow
	but comments would be nice
* there was thought about a possible administration page that allows changing
	theme, bg, etc
* modular themes, right now both themes are in style.css and it would be nice to
	have a way for users to easily add new themes. Currently we are limited to the
	light/dark themes. It should be easy enough to add support for multiple themes
	based on individual css files
* 404 handling
